\section{Summary of the Research}

This thesis addressed the critical security gap in modern software development, a consequence of high-velocity \gls{iac} practices on hyperscale cloud platforms outpacing traditional, manual security measures. The central objective was to investigate how \gls{genai} could be harnessed to develop an intelligent automation system capable of analyzing \gls{iac} configurations and automatically generating precise, preventative security policies.

To achieve this, the research employed a \gls{dsr} methodology~\cite{hevner_design_2004}, leading to two primary contributions: first, a novel conceptual framework for \gls{genai}-driven security automation, distinguished by its hybrid analysis model, a \gls{rag} architecture, and an essential \gls{hitl} validation process. Second, a functional prototype was implemented and empirically validated, proving the framework's practical feasibility with industry-standard technologies, including \gls{aws}, \gls{terraform}~\cite{howard_terraform_2022}, and \gls{opa}~\cite{the_opa_authors_open_2025}.

\section{Answering the Research Questions}

The empirical results and subsequent analysis provide clear answers to the research questions posed in Chapter~\ref{chap:introduction}.

The overarching research question was: \textit{How can Generative AI technologies be effectively leveraged to automate security operations across hyperscale cloud platforms?}
This research concludes that \gls{genai} is most effectively leveraged not as a standalone solution but as the core intelligence within a hybrid architectural framework. This framework must combine the deterministic speed of traditional static analysis for baseline scanning with the deep contextual reasoning of a \gls{llm} for nuanced threat identification. The prototype demonstrated that this approach is highly efficient, with a mean policy generation time of 9.86 seconds, making it fully compatible with modern \gls{cicd} pipelines. Furthermore, it proved highly effective at generating syntactically perfect and logically sound policies for the most critical vulnerabilities identified.

This primary conclusion is further supported by the answers to the sub-questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{How can \gls{genai} automate security policy generation and management?} \\    This work demonstrates that policy generation can be successfully automated by grounding an \gls{llm} in a curated knowledge base using a \gls{rag} architecture and implementing an automated self-correction loop for validation. This specific combination proved remarkably robust, enabling the prototype to achieve 100\% syntactic accuracy (\(A_{policy}\)) across all generated Rego policies.

    \item \textit{What architectural patterns and validation mechanisms are required for trust and accuracy?} \\
    A trustworthy architecture requires a multi-layered design (Ingestion, Analysis, Policy) and several critical validation mechanisms. The research identified two as indispensable: the automated self-correction loop for guaranteeing syntactic validity and a mandatory \gls{hitl} review process to ensure the logical soundness and contextual appropriateness of the final security artifact.

    \item \textit{How can the effectiveness of this automation be quantitatively measured?} \\
    The effectiveness of such a system can be quantitatively measured using a defined set of metrics: Policy Accuracy (\(A_{policy}\)), Policy Effectiveness (\(E_{policy}\)), and Policy Generation Speed (\(T_{gen}\)). The evaluation conducted in this thesis successfully used these metrics to reveal the crucial distinction between the system's ability to produce syntactically perfect code (100\% accuracy) and its more nuanced success in achieving logical correctness, where effectiveness varied from 36.36\% to 100\% depending on the severity of the vulnerability.

    \item \textit{What is the optimal balance between automation and human oversight?} \\
    The optimal balance is a symbiotic partnership where the system automates the laborious tasks of analysis and initial policy drafting, but final approval remains with a human expert. This conclusion is driven by the demonstrated gaps in the prototype's logical effectiveness and contextual reasoning, where it struggled with nuances like developer intent and business context. The \gls{hitl} process is therefore not a temporary scaffold but a foundational and permanent component of a safe, responsible, and effective automated security system.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Significance and Implications of the Research}

The findings of this thesis carry significant implications for the field of cloud security. The research advances the "shift-left" security paradigm~\cite{akto_shift_2025} by providing a practical blueprint for embedding automated, preventative security controls directly into the earliest stages of the development lifecycle. The proposed framework and prototype serve as a tangible guide for organizations seeking to integrate \gls{genai} into their \gls{devsecops} pipelines in a structured, effective, and responsible manner. By successfully automating the traditionally manual bottleneck of security policy creation, this work helps bridge the critical gap between high-velocity development and robust security assurance, ultimately reducing the operational burden on security teams and allowing them to focus on higher-value strategic initiatives.

\section{Limitations and Future Research}

While this study validates the core conceptual framework, its limitations, which are discussed in detail in Chapter~
\ref{chap:discussion}, must be acknowledged. The prototype was intentionally focused on a single technology stack (AWS, Terraform, and Rego), and its GenAI components were not exhaustively optimized. These constraints define clear pathways for future research.

Future work should proceed in several key directions, expanding upon the roadmap detailed in Section~\ref{sec:future_work}. The primary goals would be to expand the framework to support multi-cloud environments, conduct a systematic evaluation of different \glspl{llm} and advanced \gls{rag} techniques, and evolve the \gls{hitl} mechanism into a continuous learning system using \gls{rlhf}~\cite{ouyang_training_2022} to refine the model's accuracy and contextual understanding over time.

\section{Concluding Remarks}

This research has demonstrated that the integration of Generative AI into security automation is a viable and powerful approach to addressing the complex security challenges of modern, high-velocity cloud environments. While the nuanced judgment of human experts remains indispensable, the framework and prototype presented in this thesis lay a robust foundation for building the next generation of intelligent, context-aware security systems. These systems, built through collaboration between people and machines, are ready to meet the speed and scale required by todayâ€™s large cloud platforms.
