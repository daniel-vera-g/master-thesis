\chapter{Implementation} 
\label{Chapter4} 

This chapter concludes the description of your solution.
The division between design and implementation has to purposes:
It helps to avoid overlong chapters. And secondly by structuring the 
description in a top down way helps the reader understanding.
This now is the part where we talk about interesting details.
This has not to be complete; you can choose examples.
But it has to be complete enough for the reader so that he
could in principle repeat what you have done.



\section{Some Code}

Use the listings package for any programming examples


\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python,caption={A python listing}]
import numpy as np
    
def incmatrix(genl1,genl2):
    m = len(genl1)
    n = len(genl2)
    M = None #to become the incidence matrix
    VT = np.zeros((n*m,1), int)  #dummy variable
    
    #compute the bitwise xor matrix
    M1 = bitxormatrix(genl1)
    M2 = np.triu(bitxormatrix(genl2),1) 

    for i in range(m-1):
        for j in range(i+1, m):
            [r,c] = np.where(M2 == M1[i,j])
            for k in range(len(r)):
                VT[(i)*n + r[k]] = 1;
                VT[(i)*n + c[k]] = 1;
                VT[(j)*n + r[k]] = 1;
                VT[(j)*n + c[k]] = 1;
                
                if M is None:
                    M = np.copy(VT)
                else:
                    M = np.concatenate((M, VT), 1)
                
                VT = np.zeros((n*m,1), int)
    
    return M
