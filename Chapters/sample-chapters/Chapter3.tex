\chapter{Design} 
\label{Chapter3} 

Talk about the concepts that are the foundation of your solution
or results from a higher point of view.
Quite often it is not totally clear what is a higher point of
view. But if you are writing a large program the amount 
of indentation is normally not design, but an implementation detail,
while the distribution of tasks among the classes is design.
