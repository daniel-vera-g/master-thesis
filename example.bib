Introducing a new formative technology, generative {AI}, to cloud security has far-reaching benefits for automating threat detection, real-time incident addressing, and vulnerability management. This paper focuses on extending generative {AI} with cloud security tools like {AWS} {GuardDuty} and Google Cloud Security Command Center; the contemplation of accuracy enhancement and response efficiency highlights its aim. Concerning actual applications such as {SOAR} systems, the study demonstrates how media industry giants, such as Netflix and {JPMorgan} Chase, have used {AI} to minimize risk factors while increasing operational efficiency.

	abstract = {The emergence of cloud and hybrid cloud structures presents {eCommerce} firms with the adaptability and robustness needed to manage expansion and varying user requirements effectively. However, this also brings about challenges concerning security enhancements, distribution of workloads, and cost-effectiveness optimization. Traditional cloud management models often need help to meet these evolving demands efficiently. This research presents a system that leverages Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) and Generative {AI} (Gen {AI}) to effectively automate and enhance cloud and hybrid infrastructures for ecommerce websites. The system adapts infrastructure to traffic times like holidays or sales events by utilizing {AI} to scale resources as needed. It conserves resources during low user activity periods such as overnight. Ensuring optimal system performance and availability during peak traffic times while cutting costs during traffic periods is essential for cost-effectiveness and efficient resource management. In addition, {AI}-powered security automation safeguards against changing cyber dangers, and compliance automation guarantees conformity with rules like {PCI} {DSS} for payment handling. This report also delves into merging Gen {AI} into cloud coordination systems, facilitating workflows, and enhancing {eCommerce} processes. The outcome is a significant drop in operational expenses, a quicker service rollout, and decreased security breaches.

	abstract = {Over the last decade, Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) has become increasingly popular, especially with the use of chatbots such as {ChatGPT}, Gemini, and {DALL}-E. With this rise, large language models ({LLMs}) and Generative {AI} ({GenAI}) have also become more prevalent in everyday use. These advancements strengthen cybersecurity's defensive posture and open up new attack avenues for adversaries as well. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art deployments of {GenAI}, covering assaults, jailbreaking, and applications of prompt injection and reverse psychology. This paper also provides the various applications of {GenAI} in cybercrimes, such as automated hacking, phishing emails, social engineering, reverse cryptography, creating attack payloads, and creating malware. {GenAI} can significantly improve the automation of defensive cyber security processes through strategies such as dataset construction, safe code development, threat intelligence, defensive measures, reporting, and cyberattack detection. In this study, we suggest that future research should focus on developing robust ethical norms and innovative defense mechanisms to address the current issues that {GenAI} creates and to also further encourage an impartial approach to its future application in cybersecurity. Moreover, we underscore the importance of interdisciplinary approaches further to bridge the gap between scientific developments and ethical considerations.},

	abstract = {In response to rising concerns surrounding the safety, security, and trustworthiness of Generative {AI} ({GenAI}) models, practitioners and regulators alike have pointed to {AI} red-teaming as a key component of their strategies for identifying and mitigating these risks. However, despite {AI} red-teaming's central role in policy discussions and corporate messaging, significant questions remain about what precisely it means, what role it can play in regulation, and how it relates to conventional red-teaming practices as originally conceived in the field of cybersecurity. In this work, we identify recent cases of red-teaming activities in the {AI} industry and conduct an extensive survey of relevant research literature to characterize the scope, structure, and criteria for {AI} red-teaming practices. Our analysis reveals that prior methods and practices of {AI} red-teaming diverge along several axes, including the purpose of the activity (which is often vague), the artifact under evaluation, the setting in which the activity is conducted (e.g., actors, resources, and methods), and the resulting decisions it informs (e.g., reporting, disclosure, and mitigation). In light of our findings, we argue that while red-teaming may be a valuable big-tent idea for characterizing {GenAI} harm mitigations, and that industry may effectively apply red-teaming and other strategies behind closed doors to safeguard {AI}, gestures towards red-teaming (based on public definitions) as a panacea for every possible risk verge on security theater. To move toward a more robust toolbox of evaluations for generative {AI}, we synthesize our recommendations into a question bank meant to guide and scaffold future {AI} red-teaming practices.},

Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic approach for the automatic generation of the network security policies to be deployed in each cluster of a multi-domain Kubernetes deployment. The objectives of this approach are to reduce of configuration errors that human administrators commonly make, and to create transparent cross-cluster communications.

The collected data is then used to instantiate simulations of Markov decision processes and learn effective policies through reinforcement learning, whose performances are validated in the digital twin. This closed-loop learning process executes iteratively and provides continuously evolving and improving security policies. We apply our approach to an intrusion response scenario.

This paper reviews {GenAI}'s benefits, challenges, and research gaps in the energy sector, also focusing on climate change efforts. A {PRISMA}-{SCR}-based literature review from January 2022 to May 2024 was conducted using {IEEE} Xplore, {ScienceDirect}, {ACM} Digital Library, and Google Scholar. {GenAI} tools extracted data, verified by researchers. Analysis of 33 papers shows {GenAI} excels in knowledge integration and prediction. It generates synthetic electricity demand data, manages grids, forecasts energy demand, and optimizes renewable energy systems. Key challenges include hallucinations, data biases, privacy concerns, misuse, and system errors. Solutions involve improving training data, system fine-tuning, human oversight, and security measures. Research gaps include synthetic data realism, model evaluation standards, and integrating {GenAI} with blockchain and {IoT}.},

Snort is a famous intrusion detection system in the field of open source software. It is widely used in the intrusion prevention and detection domain in the world. In this paper, we explain how Snort implements the intrusion detection, which includes building the compiling environment and analysizing the work-flow and rule tree. This paper will provide a valuable reference for the study of Snort.},
