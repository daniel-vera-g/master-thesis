With this rise, large language models ({LLMs}) and Generative {AI} ({GenAI}) have also become more prevalent in everyday use. These advancements strengthen cybersecurity's defensive posture and open up new attack avenues for adversaries as well. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art deployments of {GenAI}, covering assaults, jailbreaking, and applications of prompt injection and reverse psychology. This paper also provides the various applications of {GenAI} in cybercrimes, such as automated hacking, phishing emails, social engineering, reverse cryptography, creating attack payloads, and creating malware. {GenAI} can significantly improve the automation of defensive cyber security processes through strategies such as dataset construction, safe code development, threat intelligence, defensive measures, reporting, and cyberattack detection. In this study, we suggest that future research should focus on developing robust ethical norms and innovative defense mechanisms to address the current issues that {GenAI} creates and to also further encourage an impartial approach to its future application in cybersecurity.

	abstract = {In response to rising concerns surrounding the safety, security, and trustworthiness of Generative {AI} ({GenAI}) models, practitioners and regulators alike have pointed to {AI} red-teaming as a key component of their strategies for identifying and mitigating these risks. However, despite {AI} red-teaming's central role in policy discussions and corporate messaging, significant questions remain about what precisely it means, what role it can play in regulation, and how it relates to conventional red-teaming practices as originally conceived in the field of cybersecurity. In this work, we identify recent cases of red-teaming activities in the {AI} industry and conduct an extensive survey of relevant research literature to characterize the scope, structure, and criteria for {AI} red-teaming practices. Our analysis reveals that prior methods and practices of {AI} red-teaming diverge along several axes, including the purpose of the activity (which is often vague), the artifact under evaluation, the setting in which the activity is conducted (e.g., actors, resources, and methods), and the resulting decisions it informs (e.g., reporting, disclosure, and mitigation). In light of our findings, we argue that while red-teaming may be a valuable big-tent idea for characterizing {GenAI} harm mitigations, and that industry may effectively apply red-teaming and other strategies behind closed doors to safeguard {AI}, gestures towards red-teaming (based on public definitions) as a panacea for every possible risk verge on security theater. To move toward a more robust toolbox of evaluations for generative {AI}, we synthesize our recommendations into a question bank meant to guide and scaffold future {AI} red-teaming practices.},

The objectives of this approach are to reduce of configuration errors that human administrators commonly make, and to create transparent cross-cluster communications.

The collected data is then used to instantiate simulations of Markov decision processes and learn effective policies through reinforcement learning, whose performances are validated in the digital twin. This closed-loop learning process executes iteratively and provides continuously evolving and improving security policies. We apply our approach to an intrusion response scenario.

To the Cloud services consumer, all the computing power and resources are accessed through high speed internet access by client platforms. This eliminates the cost to build and maintain local data center. Resource pooling and rapid elasticity are the main characters of Cloud computing. The scalability of Cloud computing comes from resources which can span multiple data centers and geographic regions. There is virtually no limitation on the amount of resources available from Cloud.

Basic defense processes, originally well understood and effective, fail to match modern attacksâ€™ complexity and velocity. Taking into consideration {LLMs} as a recent addition to {AI}, this paper aims at discussing their application in integrating threat detection and response automation systems. As a result, {LLMs}, which have higher capabilities for natural language processing, deliver a revolutionary perspective regarding cybersecurity. Since {LLM} agents can review massive amounts of security data, distinguish patterns, and create contextually appropriate responses, they can bridge the gap between emerging threats and stable security systems. The paper examines the tools used by {LLM} agents, such as natural language processing to analyse the logs, contextual anomaly detection, pattern identification in network traffic, and the analysis of the userâ€™s behaviour. Also, it describes how {LLM} agents can support automated threat handling in the context of threat identification, alert prioritization, context-driven response generation, security policy enforcement, and threat handling. The integration of {LLM} agents into already known systems, including {SIEM} systems and {AI}-Ops platforms, is also considered, which allows for further conclusions on the opportunities to create proactive cybersecurity systems. However, open dilemmas such as adversarial attacks and interpretability are still present, the future for {LLM} agents in cybersecurity is still bright, and there are more possibilities in multi-modal threat analysis and quantum-safe {LLM}-based cryptography.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation.

	abstract = {A growing number of security challenges are born out of the complexity of modern software supply chains that span microservices, containerization, and cloud-native architectures. The increasing rate of new cyber-threats, and the need to quickly deploy software updates after a security incident, typically outpaces traditional {DevSecOps} security practices. In this paper, we propose a novel {DevSecOps} Sentinel system, which employs Generative {AI} ({GenAI}) driven agentic workflows to improve software supply chain security holistically.

In this paper, we elaborate on the architecture of {DevSecOps} Sentinel: by integrating cutting-edge {GenAI} models, and by deploying intelligent agentic workflows. Then we dive into how the system impacts our software development life cycle from code writing to production and beyond. Our results indicate that agentic workflows powered by {GenAI} are a viable method to tackle the intricate security issues of modern software supply chains. Integrating the analysis capability of {AI} and marrying this with the strengths that come from agentic systems, {DevSecOps} Sentinel reveals a way forward for organizations seeking to strengthen their security profile in an ever more hostile digital world - to build better software â€” faster, safer, and reliable.},

Here's the dilemma, though: to what extent do you believe these models and the data they were trained on? We don't know the feature list of an {LLM}, which presents the first obstacle when discussing trust and the reasons why there should be zero trust. Although it may seem a bit extreme, this is accurate for two reasons. When it comes to {GenAI} models nowadays, the more multimodal and more capabilities they have, the better. This way of thinking is great for exploring and confirming if {GenAI} can address a business problem, but it's a surefire way to run into trouble when attempting to put things into production in an organizational setting. An enterprise cybersecurity architecture known as a zero-trust architecture ({ZTA}) is built on the ideas of zero trust and is intended to stop data breaches, enhance privacy, and restrict internal lateral movement. This article discusses {ZTA}, its logical aspects, probable deployment scenarios, {AI} rules, threats and limitations in order to provide a detailed understanding of why enterprises must adapt a {ZTA} framework in a cloud-based environment for {AI} model deployment.},

The aforementioned challenges are overcome with the arrival of Gen-{AI} techniques, along with their inherent ability w.r.t translation between languages, fine-tuning between various tasks and domains. In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive overview of the various work done while using Gen-{AI} techniques w.r.t user safety. In particular, we first provide the various domains (e.g. phishing, malware, content moderation, counterfeit, physical safety) across which Gen-{AI} techniques have been applied. Next, we provide how Gen-{AI} techniques can be used in conjunction with various data modalities i.e. text, images, videos, audio, executable binaries to detect violations of user-safety. Further, also provide an overview of how Gen-{AI} techniques can be used in an adversarial setting.

The development of security controls is traditionally a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. This paper explores the use of Generative {AI} to accelerate the generation of security controls. We specifically focus on generating Gherkin codes which are the domain-specific language used to define the behavior of security controls in a structured and understandable format. By leveraging large language models and in-context learning, we propose a structured framework that reduces the time required for developing security controls from 2-3 days to less than one minute. Our approach integrates detailed task descriptions, step-by-step instructions, and retrieval-augmented generation to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the generated Gherkin code. Initial evaluations on {AWS} cloud services demonstrate promising results, indicating that {GenAI} can effectively streamline the security control development process, thus providing a robust and dynamic safeguard for cloud-based infrastructures.},

The Architecture Analysis and Design Language ({AADL}), as a stringent standardized modeling language, possesses powerful expressiveness and scalability. This paper proposes a method for generating platform-specific code for the Tyche Embedded Operating System based on {AADL} models, which involves describing complex systems through {AADL} modeling and generating safety-critical software suitable for the Tyche Embedded Operating System. Firstly, the paper elaborates on the key aspects of the {AADL} standard and adheres to these aspects for modeling safety-critical systems. Secondly, an intermediate layer is introduced, outlining the mapping rules from the {AADL} common subset to the intermediate code, generating intermediate code for each component within the system architecture, and ultimately compiling it into C code applicable to the Tyche platform. Finally, a prototype tool for code generation is provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through a case study of a temperature control system.},

In addition, we provide recommendations on additional issues for a roadmap for later versions of the {AI} {RMF} or supplementary publications.

	abstract = {Software is prone to security vulnerabilities. Program analysis tools to detect them have limited effectiveness in practice due to their reliance on human labeled specifications. Large language models (or {LLMs}) have shown impressive code generation capabilities but they cannot do complex reasoning over code to detect such vulnerabilities especially since this task requires whole-repository analysis. We propose {IRIS}, a neuro-symbolic approach that systematically combines {LLMs} with static analysis to perform whole-repository reasoning for security vulnerability detection. Specifically, {IRIS} leverages {LLMs} to infer taint specifications and perform contextual analysis, alleviating needs for human specifications and inspection. For evaluation, we curate a new dataset, {CWE}-Bench-Java, comprising 120 manually validated security vulnerabilities in real-world Java projects. A state-of-the-art static analysis tool {CodeQL} detects only 27 of these vulnerabilities whereas {IRIS} with {GPT}-4 detects 55 (+28) and improves upon {CodeQL}'s average false discovery rate by 5\% points. Furthermore, {IRIS} identifies 4 previously unknown vulnerabilities which cannot be found by existing tools. {IRIS} is available publicly at https://github.com/iris-sast/iris.},

These tools have proven invaluable for generating code snippets, refactoring existing code, and providing real-time support to developers. However, their widespread adoption also presents notable challenges, particularly in terms of security vulnerabilities, code quality, and ethical concerns. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and risks associated with {AI}-powered coding tools, drawing on user feedback, security analyses, and practical use cases. We explore the potential for these tools to replicate insecure coding practices, introduce biases, and generate incorrect or non-sensical code (hallucinations). In addition, we discuss the risks of data leaks, intellectual property violations and the need for robust security measures to mitigate these threats. By comparing the features and performance of these tools, we aim to guide developers in making informed decisions about their use, ensuring that the benefits of {AI}-assisted coding are maximized while minimizing associated risks.},

	abstract = {Sophisticated phishing attacks have emerged as a major cybersecurity threat, becoming more common and difficult to prevent. Though machine learning techniques have shown promise in detecting phishing attacks, they function mainly as "black boxes" without revealing their decision-making rationale. This lack of transparency erodes the trust of users and diminishes their effective threat response. We present {EXPLICATE}: a framework that enhances phishing detection through a three-component architecture: an {ML}-based classifier using domain-specific features, a dual-explanation layer combining {LIME} and {SHAP} for complementary feature-level insights, and an {LLM} enhancement using {DeepSeek} v3 to translate technical explanations into accessible natural language. Our experiments show that {EXPLICATE} attains 98.4 \% accuracy on all metrics, which is on par with existing deep learning techniques but has better explainability. High-quality explanations are generated by the framework with an accuracy of 94.2 \% as well as a consistency of 96.8{\textbackslash}\% between the {LLM} output and model prediction. We create {EXPLICATE} as a fully usable {GUI} application and a light Chrome extension, showing its applicability in many deployment situations. The research shows that high detection performance can go hand-in-hand with meaningful explainability in security applications. Most important, it addresses the critical divide between automated {AI} and user trust in phishing detection systems.},

	abstract = {Recently, Automated Vulnerability Localization ({AVL}) has attracted much attention, aiming to facilitate diagnosis by pinpointing the lines of code responsible for discovered vulnerabilities. Large Language Models ({LLMs}) have shown potential in various domains, yet their effectiveness in vulnerability localization remains underexplored. In this work, we perform the first comprehensive study of {LLMs} for {AVL}. Our investigation encompasses 10+ leading {LLMs} suitable for code analysis, including {ChatGPT} and various open-source models, across three architectural types: encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only, with model sizes ranging from 60M to 16B parameters. We explore the efficacy of these {LLMs} using 4 distinct paradigms: zero-shot learning, one-shot learning, discriminative fine-tuning, and generative fine-tuning. Our evaluation framework is applied to the {BigVul}-based dataset for C/C++, and an additional dataset comprising smart contract vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate that discriminative fine-tuning of {LLMs} can significantly outperform existing learning-based methods for {AVL}, while other paradigms prove less effective or unexpectedly ineffective for the task. We also identify challenges related to input length and unidirectional context in fine-tuning processes for encoders and decoders. We then introduce two remedial strategies: the sliding window and the right-forward embedding, both of which substantially enhance performance. Furthermore, our findings highlight certain generalization capabilities of {LLMs} across Common Weakness Enumerations ({CWEs}) and different projects, indicating a promising pathway toward their practical application in vulnerability localization.},

This paper explores the potential of integrating artificial intelligence ({AI}) into {CTI}. We provide a blueprint of an {AI}-enhanced {CTI} processing pipeline and detail its components and functionalities. The pipeline highlights the collaboration between {AI} and human expertise, which is necessary to produce timely and high-fidelity cyber threat intelligence.

However, the integration of {AI} into {CTI} is not without its challenges. Thereby, we discuss the ethical dilemmas, potential biases, and the imperative for transparency in {AI}-driven decisions. We address the need for data privacy, consent mechanisms, and the potential misuse of technology. Moreover, we highlight the importance of addressing biases both during {CTI} analysis and within {AI} models, warranting their transparency and interpretability. Lastly, our work points out future research directions, such as the exploration of advanced {AI} models to augment cyber defenses, and humanâ€“{AI} collaboration optimization.

	abstract = {As cloud infrastructures become increasingly complex and integral to modern enterprises, the demand for advanced, real-time security solutions has grown significantly. Traditional anomaly detection systems often struggle to keep pace with the rapid evolution of cyber threats in these dynamic environments, particularly when faced with novel or sophisticated attacks. Such systems typically rely on predefined rules or signature-based detection, which limits their effectiveness in identifying emerging security risks. This paper explores the potential of generative {AI} models, specifically {LLaMA} and {OpenAI}â€™s {GPT} architectures, to enhance real-time cloud security. By leveraging the advanced pattern recognition and adaptive capabilities of these models, we propose a framework that can analyze vast amounts of cloud data, including logs, network traffic, user behavior, and system activities, to detect abnormal patterns indicative of security threats. The real-time anomaly detection offered by generative {AI} provides a significant advantage over traditional methods, as it continuously learns from new data, thereby improving its ability to identify novel threats in complex cloud environments.This research addresses key gaps in current cloud security practices, highlighting the limitations of existing systems in detecting previously unknown threats. The proposed approach introduces generative {AI} as a highly adaptive and scalable solution for cloud anomaly detection, capable of responding to evolving threats in real-time. By using models such as {GPT}, which are known for their ability to generate coherent predictions based on diverse inputs, the framework offers a novel means of safe-guarding cloud infrastructure. This study not only underscores the benefits of employing generative {AI} for security purposes but also provides a robust methodology for integrating these models into cloud security systems. The paper concludes with an assessment of the practical deployment of these {AI} models in large-scale cloud environments, demonstrating their potential to significantly enhance the resilience and adaptability of modern cloud security frameworks.},

	abstract = {Policy as Code represents a transformative approach to infrastructure security and governance in modern cloud environments. By codifying security and compliance policies as machine-readable code, organizations can automate enforcement throughout the development lifecycle. This paradigm shift addresses the velocity gap between rapid development cycles and traditionally slower security processes, enabling consistent policy enforcement without sacrificing agility. The integration with {CI}/{CD} pipelines allows for "shifting left" security considerations, identifying and remediating issues before they reach production. Various implementation approaches have emerged, from open-source tools like Open Policy Agent to cloud-native solutions, each with distinct advantages. While implementation challenges exist, including policy language complexity and organizational alignment, established best practices help organizations navigate these hurdles. As infrastructure continues to evolve, Policy as Code emerges as an essential strategy for maintaining security and compliance in dynamic, cloud-native environments, transforming governance from a perceived roadblock into an enabler of innovation.},

	abstract = {Developing a software service requires a strict software development life cycle and process. This process demands controlling all application code through source control management as well as a rigorous versioning and branching strategy. However, the platform and infrastructure also benefit from this rigor. Software services must be deployed to a target run time environment and provisioning that environment through manual user actions is tedious and error-prone. Provisioning manually also becomes prohibitive as the number of resources grow and spread globally over multiple regions. The answer is to apply the same rigor to provisioning the infrastructure as applied to developing the application software. Terraform provides a platform allowing infrastructure resources to be defined in code. This code not only allows the automation of the infrastructure provisioning but also allows for a strict development and review life cycle, same as the application software.},
