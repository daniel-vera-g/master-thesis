\noindent I, \authorname, hereby declare that generative artificial intelligence (AI) was employed as a writing assistant in the development of this manuscript. The use of these tools was exclusively for linguistic enhancement, such as refining sentence structure, correcting grammar, and improving overall style. The conceptual framework, original ideas, research methodology, data analysis, and final conclusions presented in this work are the product of my own intellectual effort. I have critically reviewed, edited, and validated all content to ensure its accuracy and originality, and I bear complete responsibility for the entirety of this thesis.
